# Blocks

Notes consist of blocks. Each block has a type:
* markdown
* plain text
* code block (JavaScript, Go and 30+ other programming languages)
* math block

Mod + L to change the type of block
Mod + B to navigate between blocks

Blocks have alternate background color.

If current block is Go or JavaScript block, you can run it:

- `Alt + Shift + R` keyboard shortcut
- context menu: `Run / Run <javascript> block`
- command palette: `Block: Run <language> block`

The output of execution will be shown in a new block created below the executed block.

You can run JavaScript functions with the content of a current block or a selection.

The function gets the content as argument, can traform it, and we show the output in a block below.

For example a function can sort the lines in a block, calculate md5 hash or transform it to upper case. The possibilities are literally limitless.

To run a JavasScript function with content of block:
- context menu: `Run` / `Run function with block content`
- command palette: `Run function with block content`
- pick a function from the list

To run a JavasScript function with selection:
- context menu: `Run` / `Run function with selection`
- command palette: `Run function with selection`
- pick a function from the list

If you want to see all built-in functions use:
- context menu: `Run`, `Show built-in functions`
- command palette: `Shw built-in functions`
